# One-Night-Risk

## Introduction
This is horror game of a man being locked inside an abandoned house, developed using Unity and C#. In this game, the weather is getting really cold outside, so there is no time to waste because death can come within minutes. However, getting outside the house is not easy at all, as the player has to go through multiple puzzles and challenges to unlock the next secret and maybe escape from this nightmare.

## Development
The game was developed using Unity and C#. Many of the lighting system was developed using point light and menu was built with Unity UI system. 

## Challenges
The hardest challenge I went through was the jumpscare cutscene, in which I have made a script for the lighting system and the animation of the monster aligned with each other. There was no direct solution to this cutscene, but changing the lighting time to public made the cutscene set up a lot easier.

## Innovation
The next phase of the game can be a combination between Identity V multiplayer game and Little Nightmares monster style. The ending of this game will explain why I chose this decision.

## Notes
Some components inside the Asset folder and Libary folder is too large to be commited to Github. However, the current asset folder is good enough to re-build the game.
